Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software 
requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want 
you to design?
The company had a game and wanted it to be convereted so it could be used on many different applications instead of one. It would render an image slowly and players would guess what it was.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I thought I understood the needs of the client well and the best way to implement it. I also provided valuable data when it came to monitization and how to scale the game.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I thought the design document was useful when it came to organization of throughts.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I could've went into more detail in a lot of sections. I feel like the reqquirements or design constraints could've been improved with more detail.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your 
software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs 
when designing?
It's important to consider the user's needs while designing software because they are the one whos paying. It's also them who will receive the final product and have to use it so their needs have to be meet.
